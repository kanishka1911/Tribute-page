<h2>A brief summary of Vivekanad's journey</h2>
<h3>Early life</h3>
<p>
    Swami Vivekananda was born on 12 January 1863, in Kolkata (earlier Calcutta). He was a spiritual leader and social reformer. 
    His lectures, writings, letters, poems, and ideas motivated not only the youth of India but also the whole world.
    He is the founder of Ramakrishna Mission and Belur Mathin Calcutta, which are still working towards helping the needy. 
    He was a man of wisdom and a very simple human being.
</p>
<h3>Spiritual Crisis and Relationship with Ramkrishna Paramhansa</h3>
<p>
    Although Narendranath’s mother was a devout woman and he had grown up in a religious atmosphere at home, he underwent a deep spiritual crisis at the start of his youth. His well-studied knowledge led him to question the existence of God and for some time he believed in Agnosticism. 
    Yet he could not completely ignore the existence of a Supreme Being. 
    He became associated with Brahmo Movement led by Keshab Chandra Sen, for some time. 
    The Bramho Samaj recognised one God unlike the idol-worshipping, superstition-ridden Hinduism. 
    The host of philosophical questions regarding the existence of God roiling through his mind remained unanswered. 
    During this spiritual crisis, Vivekananda first heard about Sri Ramakrishna from William Hastie, the Principal of the Scottish Church College.
</p>
<h3>Spiritual Awakening</h3>
<p>
    In 1884, Naredranath underwent a considerable financial distress due to the death of his father as he had to support his mother and younger siblings. 
    He asked Ramakrishna to pray to the Goddess for the financial welfare of his family. On Ramakrishna’s suggestion he himself went to the temple to pray. 
    But once he faced the Goddess he could not ask for money and wealth, instead he asked for ‘Vivek’ (conscience) and ‘Bairagya’ (reclusion). 
    That day marked the complete spiritual awakening of Narendranath and he found himself drawn to an ascetic way of life.

<h3>Life of a Monk</h3>
<p>During the middle of 1885, Ramakrishna, who had been suffering from throat cancer, fell seriously ill. 
    In September 1885, Sri Ramakrishna was moved to Shyampukur in Culcutta, and a few months later Narendranath took a rented villa at Cossipore. 
    Here, he formed a group of young people who were ardent followers of Sri Ramakrishna and together they nursed their Guru with devoted care. 
    On 16 August 1886, Sri Ramakrishna gave up his mortal body.</p>
<h3>Lecture at the World Parliament of Religions</h3>
<p>
    During the course of his wanderings, he came to know about the World Parliament of Religions being held in Chicago, America in 1893. 
    He was keen to attend the meeting, to represent India, Hinduism and his Guru Sri Ramakrishna’s philosophies. 
    He found assertion of his wishes while he was meditating on the rocks of Kanyakumari, the southernmost tip of India. 
    Money was raised by his disciples in Madras (now Chennai) and Ajit Singh, Raja of Khetri, and Vivekananda left for Chicago on May 31, 1893 from Bombay 
</p>
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>
    Swami Vivekananda had predicted that he will not live till the age of forty. 
    On July 4, 1902, he went about his days’ work at the Belur Math, teaching Sanskrit grammar to the pupils. 
    He retired to his room in the evening and died during meditation at around 9. He is said to have attained ‘Mahasamadhi’ and the great saint was cremated on the Banks of river Ganga.
